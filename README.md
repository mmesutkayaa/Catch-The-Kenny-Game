# Catch-The-Kenny-Game

In this game we are trying to capture a visual that we call "Kenny". Every time you catch Kenny, you earn points and you can track your instant score from the scoreboard. You have 15 seconds to catch Kenny! UserDefaults was used as a data saving method, since only points were saved in this game. At the end of the game, when the 15 seconds time has expired, a pop-up window opens asking if you want to play again.
